<p>早上看RSS订阅的时候，发现DH有一则公告，仔细看了下，原来其准备升级到Rails2.0.2版本了，看来Rails2的时代以及来临了，引起原话如下：</p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>&ldquo;</strong></font>Just when I thought it was safe to upgrade, another version appears!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start upgrading our servers to Rails 2.0.2. This involves packaging, testing, and then slowly rolling it out. The jump is to a 2.x version from 1.2.6, so I&rsquo;m going to take my time with this one to make sure nothing goes horribly wrong, so it might be right after the new year when it&rsquo;s all done, just to be safe.</p>
<p>For your new year&rsquo;s resolution, you will freeze your rails! Login via shell, and in your rails directory, run &ldquo;rake freeze_gems&rdquo; - that should do the trick!</p>
<p>Please contact support if you have any questions or concerns.<strong><font size="5">&rdquo;</font></strong></p>
