<p>晚上收到Amazon的AWS的邮件,说降价了,哈,真是好消息,前台在写&lt;<a href="http://iceskysl.1sters.com/?action=show&amp;id=253">Google App Engine,前途无量,充满乐趣</a>&gt;的时候,还说到&quot;<em><strong>同时，不可否认，会给亚马逊的S3,EC2,SQS等带来一些竞争，当然，这会使得这个领域更加合理和更多的选择。</strong></em>&quot;,不想到,这么快,Amazon就有动作了,真是好消息,直接看原文吧,总觉得用中文把E文再重复一遍挺浪费的,也比较别扭,总感觉有些外文不好使用中文表述出来,呵呵.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Dear Amazon Web Services developers,
<p>We've often told you that one of our goals is to drive down costs continuously and to pass those savings on to you. We have been able to reduce our costs for data transfer, so we're pleased to announce that we're lowering our pricing for data transfer, effective May 1, 2008. You'll notice below that we've reduced price at every existing usage tier of transfer out, as well as added an additional tier for the heaviest users.</p>
<p><strong>Current data transfer price (through April 30, 2008)</strong><br />
$0.100 per GB - data transfer in<br />
$0.180 per GB - first 10 TB / month data transfer out<br />
$0.160 per GB - next 40 TB / month data transfer out<br />
$0.130 per GB - data transfer out / month over 50 TB</p>
<p>Data transfer &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; refers to transfer into and out of the Amazon service. Data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3-US, Amazon SimpleDB and Amazon SQS is free of charge (i.e., $0.00 per GB). Data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3-Europe will be charged at regular rates.</p>
<p><strong>New data transfer price (effective May 1, 2008)</strong><br />
$0.100 per GB - data transfer in<br />
$0.170 per GB - first 10 TB / month data transfer out<br />
$0.130 per GB - next 40 TB / month data transfer out<br />
$0.110 per GB - next 100 TB / month data transfer out<br />
$0.100 per GB - data transfer out / month over 150 TB</p>
<p>Data transfer &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; refers to transfer into and out of the Amazon service. Data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3-US, Amazon SimpleDB and Amazon SQS is free of charge (i.e., $0.00 per GB). Data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3-Europe will be charged at regular rates.</p>
<p>The result of this pricing change is that all customers will see a reduction in the price of transfer out. For example, a customer transferring 50TB a month will save 16% and a customer transferring 500TB a month will save 26% on transfer with the new pricing. Please see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=VJJ7UKH1T0MK&amp;C=2EY6D8X22VKHD&amp;H=vYT8cpDrSAfwEEXC4UGHM3dWLh0A&amp;T=C&amp;U=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com">http://aws.amazon.com</a> for full pricing information for each service.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
The Amazon Web Services Team</p>

<p>当然了,你也可以到Amazon官方网站上看到这个消息,<a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/ann.jspa?annID=313">&quot;Announcement: Lower Data Transfer Costs&quot;</a></p>
<p>AWS越来越成熟,在继支持静态IP和固定存储后,这又是一个大的变化,如果啥时能使得国内的访问速度提上去的话,对国内的WEB人员将是最大的幸福了.继续期待...</p>
