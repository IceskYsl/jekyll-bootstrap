To install a new theme, select one of the .tmTheme links listed below, download it to your desktop and double-click on the file. This will place it in ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Themes, at which point the new theme will appear in the list found in Preferences â†’ Fonts &amp; Colors. This will also set it as the active theme. (Once the theme is installed, you may remove the .tmTheme from your desktop.)
