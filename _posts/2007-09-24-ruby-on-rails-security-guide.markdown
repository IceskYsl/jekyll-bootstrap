<p>好久没去ROR官方站点了，今天google到他上面的一个wiki，看完后随手到其blog里面看看，看到一篇好文章，是介绍Rails中安全控制的，于是跟着那个链接过去，看了一部分，没时间看完，特转回来记录着有时间再看～</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails does a decent job in handling security concerns in the background. You will have to configure your application to avoid few security attacks while plugins would be required for many security concerns which are not at all or poorly managed by rails.</p>
<p>In this article I have described the security issues related to a ruby on rails web application. I have followed <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> by linking to articles with good explanation and solutions to security concerns wherever required. This guide can also be used as a quick security check for your current web application.</p>
