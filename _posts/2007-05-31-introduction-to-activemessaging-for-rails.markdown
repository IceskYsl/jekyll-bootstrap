ActiveMessaging是个感觉很不错的一个插件，通过它你可以发送、接收MO，总得来说很有诱惑力，还没有看完，下面这篇文章对这个东西做了详细的介绍，感兴趣的可以自己去看看，我就不翻译了，等我自己试用后，可以再些些心得什么的。*introduction*Rails has already planted its flag firmly in the ground of database driven web applications. *ActiveMessaging*is a Rails plugin framework that extends the borders of Rails territory by adding simplified messaging integration. With ActiveMessaging and Rails now you can loosely integrate with systems as disparate as mainframes sending MQ messages or J2EE webapps, offload processing long-running tasks, or create applications with event or message-driven architectures. As others have put it, ActiveMessaging is trying to do for messaging what ActiveRecord does for databases. This article will introduce you to ActiveMessaging and related technologies, and get you started using it in your Rails applications now.http://www.infoq.com/articles/intro-active-messaging-rails
