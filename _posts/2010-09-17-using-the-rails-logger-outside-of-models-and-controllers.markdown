You might be used to doing the following in your models or controllers:

<em>logger.info "Some debugging info I want to see in my development log."</em>

If you make a regular model that doesnâ€™t inherit from ActiveRecord, though, you may see the following error:

undefined local variable or method `logger' for #&lt;Class:0x42fd77c&gt;

The solution is to call <strong>Rails</strong>.logger.info (or debug, or warn) as follows:

<em>Rails.logger.info "Some debugging info I want to see in my development log."</em>

I hope that helps someone.
